# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

1. npm run dev
2. Login to metamask
3. Connect to wallet by clicking 'connect wallet'
4. copy & paste account2 address in 'Address to' section from metamask
5. Switch back to account1
6. click on send now
